[1.0.12]

**Fixed**
* Farm Animals not being breedable anymore

***

[1.0.11]

**Fixed**
* Fixed a critical issue where the game would crash on servers due to client-only code being called from the `AnimalEntityMixin`. Everything worked fine in singleplayer, but not on dedicated servers.  
  This patch restores proper server compatibility for all new saturation mechanics. :)

_P.S.: Sorry for the hiccup – this ones on me_

[1.0.10]

## This small update focuses on adding new mechanics that enhance loot from farm animals, selected F&C crops, and eggs through interaction, care, and environmental factors.

**Added**
* A Pet Bowl! - Feed your cat or dog with a `Pet Bowl`. Occasionally, pets will walk up to an empty bowl and beg for food. Feeding grants temporary bonuses. You can assign a Name Tag to dedicate a bowl to a specific pet.
* Chicken Nest: When placed near chickens, eggs are laid directly into the nest instead of falling to the ground. The nest can hold up to 2 eggs. Occasionally (5% chance), a feather may also be added.* Chicken Coop: Works like similar to a bee nest. Chickens nearby will enter the coop when ready to lay an egg. Holds up to 6 chickens at once.
* Farm animals can now be fed their preferred food. The more often they are fed, the more meat they will drop. Feeding progress is visible only when wearing...
* ...`Dungarees`! – While equipped, shows feed levels above animals. Also prevents trampling farmland while wearing them. They can be bought from Farmer Villagers.
* Certain F&C crops now have a small chance to grow into larger variants when near a water sprinkler or during rain. Larger crops have an increased chance of yielding multiple drops.
* Farmer Villagers have now a Chance to offer several F&C related Items.
* Chicken Coop: Functions similarly to a bee nest. Chickens enter on their own to lay eggs and rest. Up to 9 Eggs can be stored at once. Players can also manually insert a leashed chicken. Eggs are automatically collected, and chickens exit after a short time.
* When placing SugarCare on Fertilized Soil it will grow 20% faster
* Dog & Cat Food can now be crafted into Bags. These can be placed and stacked up to 3 times.
* Support for DoggyTalents
* Japanese translation _(Thanks to PExPE3)_

**Fixed**
* Recipe for Yeast had wrong tags as Ingredients
* fr_fr translation
* EffectFood returns itself after being consumed, which is likely unintended.
